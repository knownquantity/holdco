<p>the internet used to be strange, social and expressive</p>
<p>now, it's algorithmic, optimized and calculated</p>
<p>ninetynine labs build networks, social experiences and community products designed for intimacy and intrigue, like they were in 1999</p>
<p>online and offline destinations that feel secret, where culture moves sideways, not up</p>
<p>we believe the next wave of consumer applications will be built on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>symbolic access and earned intimacy</li>
  <li>shared rituals and cultural capital as the foundation of social graphs</li>
  <li>human-to-human interaction as the core driver of discovery, creativity and belonging</li>
</ul>
