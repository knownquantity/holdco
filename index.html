<h3>lore</h3>
<ul>
  <li>before the internet became a stage, it was a workshop</li> 
  <li>then, it got optimized. content turned into performance. social into scale. culture into collateral.</li> 
  <li>what was once experiential and exclusive is now designed to be widely documented, distributed and consumed</li> 
  <li>ninetynine labs is a return to the workshop era. where things are made deliberately, together, and behind closed doors
  <li>networks, social experiences and community products optimized for intimacy and intrigue</li>
  <li>the most valuable online destinations will feel secret, and the best parties ungoogleable</li> 
  <li>culture scales sideways, not up</li> 
  <li>shared rituals and cultural capital are better building blocks for social graphs</li> 
  <li>symbolic access and earned intimacy will define the next breakout consumer applications</li> 
  <li>1999 was a fun year</li> 
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>when done deliberately, human-to-human interaction becomes a powerful engine for discovery, creativity and belonging</li>
  <li>when done with intention, humans can move ideas and culture further than a feed ever could</li>
</ul>
